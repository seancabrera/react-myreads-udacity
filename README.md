# MyReads Project
---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to use React to create a "MyReads" app that allows the user to categorize books into shelfs including "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read". Udacity provided a backend server with an API for searching for books and saving the user's selections. Udacity also provided some starter code with HTML and CSS. I developed all of the React code to make the app functional.
